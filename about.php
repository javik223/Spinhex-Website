        <h2>Why Spinhex?</h2>

        <p>
            In Nigeria in the 70s and early 80s, Disc Jockeys (DJs) were the toast of both the social scene and night club life. They were social celebrities receiving applause from the crowd as the deck. There were always heightened excitement in the clubs at the mere sight of DJs. Today, contemporary DJs are looked won upon, and so studio DJs have taken over. Night clubs and their owners most often prefer the use of studio recorded long play CDs and albums, thereby eliminating the extra fun and excitement created by the Disc Jockeys ability to scratch and improvise on the turn table. The main objective of The National Spinhex DJ Championship, is to recreate the myth of the Disc Jockeys of the good old days; the magic of the turn table as displayed by the Alex Condis, Murphy Okgies, Kunle Jobs, Stagger Lees and the rest of them who were the rave and toast of night clubbers of the 70s and 80s. Spinhex intends to rekindle the interest of young men and women in the noble profession of Disc Jockeying and also draw the attention of the entertainment industry to the importance of DJ as an integral part of the ever growing industry. ..
